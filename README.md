# Victor Hackathon List
This repository serves as a showcase for the hackathons in which I've actively participated. The list is exclusive to serious competitions that offer significant rewards, such as thousands of euros, job offers, or one-to-one discussions with high-profile tech leaders.  You can check the deployed website [here](https://victorfigma.github.io/Hackthon-List/)👈🏻.
